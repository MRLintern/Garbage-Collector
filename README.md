# Garbage Collector

This project creates a Garbage Collector for detecting memory leaks using Modern C++.

A memory leak occurs when a program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way
that memory which is no longer needed is not released.

# Building the Application
The compiler used is g++ from the GNU Compiler Collection. You can also use gcc.

Compiling:

``$./make``

And then:

``$./compiled``
